# SCT_DS_1 - Population Analysis (Tableau)
Key Visual Created Bar Chart showing population distribution
Labeling of population figures for clear comparison:
X-axis: Country or group name  
Y-axis: Population in 2022
Key Learnings: 
- Creating clean bar charts in Tableau
- Formatting axes and values for billions
- Sorting categories by population size
- Analyzing demographic patterns
Insight Gained:
- Low & middle-income countries together hold the majority of the world’s population.
- East Asia & Pacific region is among the most populous in the world.

# SCT_DS_2 - Titanic Dataset Analysis (EDA & Data Cleaning)
Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
 Key Steps
- Loaded and cleaned missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`
- Created new features like `FamilySize`, `Title` from `Name`
- Visualized survival rate across `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare`
- Handled outliers using visualization
- Exported cleaned dataset
 Insights
- Females had higher survival rates
- Passengers in 1st class survived more than 3rd
- Higher fares often led to higher survival

# SCT_DS_3 - Decision Tree Classifier: Bank Marketing Dataset
In this task, I worked with the Bank Marketing dataset to build a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
I cleaned and preprocessed the data using label encoding and handled categorical variables. Then I trained the decision tree using entropy as the splitting criterion.
The model achieved around 86% accuracy, and I analyzed the most influential features such as contact method, job type, and previous outcomes.
Through this, I learned how to:
Train and tune a decision tree model
Use confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation
Interpret tree structures to understand decision paths

# SCT_DS_4 - Traffic Accident Data Analysis
This task involved analyzing a large traffic accident dataset to identify patterns related to accident severity, road conditions, weather, and time.
I explored how different factors such as lighting conditions, number of vehicles, and time of day affect accident outcomes. I also visualized accident trends over weekdays and hours.
The analysis showed that:
Accidents are more severe in poor light and bad weather
Urban roads and peak hours had higher accident frequency
Higher vehicle involvement increases severity
This task helped me understand:
How to analyze time-based and categorical variables?
Visualize trends with Seaborn and Matplotlib
Derive actionable safety insights from raw data
